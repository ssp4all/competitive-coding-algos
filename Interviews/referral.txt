SUB: Referral request for Entry level SDE at Citrix



Hi Vishrut,



I hope you are healthy and well.



I am about to start applying for an entry-level role in Software Engineering and would love to showcase my skills and experience in the field to the Hiring managers. Citrix is the amazing cloud company that I am targeting, as well as it has a recent job opening for new grads. If you have a minute, would you mind referring me?



A little bit about my self, my full name is Suraj Pawar. I am a second-year graduate student pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at NC State University with a specialization in Data Science. This summer, I interned at Murano Corp. which is an AI Supply chain company based in RTP, NC where I worked as a software engineering intern. There I was responsible for optimizing existing features in the Murano's flagship supply chain management system. One of my major tasks was to improve the existing search feature for which I had used Elastic Search using Java. Apart from this, I am seasoned with Python, Java, JavaScript, and their respective frameworks.



I would appreciate if you can refer me to Citrix for the SDE position. I am available any time to discuss my profile with you also let me know if you need additional information, I'd happy to talk with you. Looking forward to hearing from you.



Thank you so much.
