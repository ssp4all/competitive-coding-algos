Looking for a summer internship at Lenovo

Hi Mark

I hope you are doing well.

I'm a graduate student pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at NC State Univerisity.

I am looking for a summer internship in the Software Engineering domain which is my main area of interest. I am seasoned with programming languages like Python, Java and DevOps tools such as Ansible and Jenkins. After gaining experience in developing software applications in coursework/projects, I am looking for an internship in the cloud computing domain where I can use my problem-solving skills to build exciting products using DevOps. Redhat's Ansible and variety of cloud services make it one of the innovative companies in this domain that I want to work for.

I request you to please let me know if you have an open position and also if you have any questions. I have attached my resume for your reference and thank you for your time and considerations.

Sincerely
Suraj
