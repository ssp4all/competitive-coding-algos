Openâ€“closed principle[7]

"Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

Liskov substitution principle[8]

"Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program." See also design by contract.

Interface segregation principle[9]

"Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."[4]

Dependency inversion principle[10]

One should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."[4]
