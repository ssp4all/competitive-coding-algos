Working with the latest technologies has been a real joy to me. My proudest accomplishment was to assist my professor in his research which later gets a grant from the National Science Foundation as well as my professor's research paper for which I assisted got accepted in one of the prestigious ICML conferences. My professor accoladed me for my programming skills which were a surreal moment in my whole life.


Algorithms, data structure's knowledge has already been my strong point. Doing a master's in Computer Science has allowed me to delve deeper into this field. Now I wish to use my knowledge to solve real-life problems. For the same, I think Palantir is the perfect match because working with products like PALANTIR's GOTHAM and FOUNDRY will allow me to use my problem-solving skills to extract information from the huge amount of data.
