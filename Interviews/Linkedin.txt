Hi


Thank you so much for taking the #plusonepledge initiative.

Being a first-year Master's student, I am looking for a summer internship but unfortunately due to #COVID19 lots of companies are going on a hiring freeze which has made the job search even more difficult. I would highly appreciate it if you could offer me a #linkedinpremium membership.

In anticipation and appreciation,
Suraj

Hi Katherine

I hope you are doing well.
I have recently applied for a Summer SDE intern position at Wonderlic. I would really appreciate it if we can connect here. 
Thank you for your time and considerations

Cheers!
