Hi


Thank you so much for taking the #plusonepledge initiative.

Being a first-year Master's student, I am looking for a summer internship but unfortunately due to #COVID19 lots of companies are going on a hiring freeze which has made the job search even more difficult. I would highly appreciate it if you could offer me a #linkedinpremium membership.

In anticipation and appreciation,
Suraj

Looking for a summer internship

Hi Mark



I hope you are doing well.



I am a first-year graduate student looking for an SDE internship where I can use my problem-solving skills and proactively learn from my peers. I'm a seasoned full-stack developer with experience in software development which mostly involves programming languages such as Python, Java and little bit C++. My projects and previous internships allowed me to work on tech stacks such as React, Django, REST API's and databases. Apart from that, I have a minor interest in Machine Learning and Data analytics.



I'm really excited and looking forward to hearing from you. Thank you so much for your time and considerations. I have attached my resume for your reference.



Sincerely

Suraj
