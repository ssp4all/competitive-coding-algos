I am a Graduate student at Arizona State University with a key focus in machine learning, deep learning, and NLP. I am interested in dealing with different ways of making intelligent decisions from the data in real-world scenarios that create an immediate impact on the end-users.

I am deeply interested in leveraging the REST services to interact with machine learning models thus truly developing an end to end pipeline on the backend side and delivering real-time data decisions. I have built strong expertise in Python, Django, Java, Spring, AWS, Docker, Knockout JS working as a software developer for over 3 years.

To bolster the skills in machine learning, I have developed projects demonstrating the use of different machine learning and NLP techniques used on structured as well as unstructured data. I have enrolled for the course “Multimedia and Web Databases” to primarily approach multimedia pattern discovery and data retrieval through machine learning.
Having visited the ICML 2019, I was able to appreciate the research perspective in ML, which has allowed me to work on research-based projects in the field of ML and NLP in the current year.


Specialties:
Languages: Java, Python, C, C++, Javascript, MATLAB
Technologies: Android, Pandas, AWS S3, Spring Boot, Nginx, MongoDB, MYSQL, AngularJS, Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit-Learn, AllenNLP, Pytorch, Jupyter, Docker, Django Framework, Git, Jenkins, KnockoutJS, Linux, Apache Spark, Spark SQL
Interests: Web, REST, Applied Machine Learning, Data Science, NLP
---------------------------------
What has been your favorite project or proudest accomplishment? Why?
-> During my internship I got to work on developing search feature using RestApi and Elastic Search. I got to learn a lot during that period.
