Hi


Thank you so much for taking the #plusonepledge initiative.

Being a first-year Master's student, I am looking for a summer internship but unfortunately due to #COVID19 lots of companies are going on a hiring freeze which has made the job search even more difficult. I would highly appreciate it if you could offer me a #linkedinpremium membership.

In anticipation and appreciation,
Suraj

Looking for a summer internship

Hi Lindsay

I hope you are doing well.

I am a first-year graduate student looking for an SDE internship where I can use my problem-solving skills and proactively learn from my peers. I'm a seasoned full-stack developer with experience in software development which mostly involves programming languages such as Python, Java, and little bit C++. During my projects and previous internships, I have worked on various technologies such as React, Django, Git, REST APIs, and databases. Apart from that, I have a minor interest in Machine Learning and Data analytics.

Please let me know if you have an open position in SDE/DS domain or when you'd be open to a conversation. I’m happy to provide you with any additional information you might need. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely

I am a Graduate student at Arizona State University with a key focus in machine learning, deep learning, and NLP. I am interested in dealing with different ways of making intelligent decisions from the data in real-world scenarios that create an immediate impact on the end-users.

I am deeply interested in leveraging the REST services to interact with machine learning models thus truly developing an end to end pipeline on the backend side and delivering real-time data decisions. I have built strong expertise in Python, Django, Java, Spring, AWS, Docker, Knockout JS working as a software developer for over 3 years.

To bolster the skills in machine learning, I have developed projects demonstrating the use of different machine learning and NLP techniques used on structured as well as unstructured data. I have enrolled for the course “Multimedia and Web Databases” to primarily approach multimedia pattern discovery and data retrieval through machine learning.
Having visited the ICML 2019, I was able to appreciate the research perspective in ML, which has allowed me to work on research-based projects in the field of ML and NLP in the current year.
