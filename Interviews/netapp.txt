Hi Michelle

I hope you are doing well.

I'm a first-year graduate student on an F1 visa pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at NC State University.

For the upcoming summer, I am looking for an internship in the Software Engineering domain which is my main area of interest. 

Being a CS student, I am inclined towards Software-Engineering also I am seasoned with programming languages like Python, Java and good at cloud technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS. 

I request you to please let me know if you have an open position in the SDE. I've attached my resume for your reference. Thank you for your time and considerations.


Sincerely
Suraj
