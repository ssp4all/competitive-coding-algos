Hi PJ

I hope you are doing well.

I'm a first-year graduate student on an F1 visa pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at NC State Univerisity.

For the upcoming summer, I am looking for an internship in the Software Engineering domain which is my main area of interest. 

Being a CS student, I am inclined towards Software-Engineering also I am seasoned with programming languages like Python, Java and good at cloud technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, and GCP, AWS. 

I request you to please let me know if you have an open position in the SDE and also if have any questions.

Thank you for your time and considerations.

PS: I have attached my resume for your reference.

Sincerely
Suraj
