Hi Ashley



Hope you doing well.



My name is Suraj and I'm pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at NC State Univerisity.



I am looking for a summer internship in the Software Engineering domain which is my main area of interest. Today I received an email from the NetApp that they are actively hiring for summer interns because I had visited their desk during a spring career fair at the NCSU.



I am seasoned with programming languages like Python, Java and good at cloud technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, and GCP, AWS. Having a good experience of developing software applications using DevOps tools, I am looking for an internship in the cloud computing domain and NetApp is one of the market leaders in this field that I want to for.



I request you to please let me know if you have any open position regarding same and also if have any questions.



Thank you for your time and considerations.



Sincerely

Suraj
