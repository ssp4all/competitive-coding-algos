"""
Design a search autocomplete system for a search engine. Users may input 
a sentence (at least one word and end with a special character '#'). 
For each character they type except '#', you need to return the top 3 
historical hot sentences that have prefix the same as the part of sentence already typed. 
Here are the specific rules:

The hot degree for a sentence is defined as the number of times a user 
typed the exactly same sentence before.
The returned top 3 hot sentences should be sorted by hot degree (The 
first is the hottest one). If several sentences have the same degree of hot, 
you need to use ASCII-code order (smaller one appears first).
If less than 3 hot sentences exist, then just return as many as you can.
When the input is a special character, it means the sentence ends, and in this case, 
you need to return an empty list.
Your job is to implement the following functions:
